# Recreation of Asteroids in Processing
This is a small recreation of the Asteroids game done as part of a group assignment.

It was written and runs using the Processing language and GUI.

Although done early in my studies, this project gave me a helpful understanding in using graphics in programming, how they interact and how to manipulate them to create motion.
